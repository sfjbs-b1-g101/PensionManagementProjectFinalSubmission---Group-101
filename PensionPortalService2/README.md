<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Given the discouraging record of the traditional pension system and the limited coverage of the private-sector pension schemes, there is need for robust web-based pension fundmanagement system that can handle the pension process efficiently. This work focus on the design and implementation of a web-based pension fund management application to replace the manual system, thus getting rid of the hurdles involved in the traditional pension management process.

The purpose of this program is to develop a system that would keep records of employees or pensioners data including their pension plan, allowances, gratuity, taxes, net pay, rent pay and also calculate the pay of the pensioners taking into consideration the pensionerâ€™s data.
